//**STARTING REACT**

**Back Story**:
1. Conversion of Req,Res Model.
2. AJAX BASED MODEL
3. JSX BASED MODEL


**Key Features**:
-> Component Based Archhitecture
-> Virtual Dom
-> Unidirectional Data Flow
-> JSX Syntax
-> SEO Performance

-> Component is fudmental unit of any React application, capable of encapsulating data and view as a single unit.It makes code reusable, testing easy.

-> Here, in React, components reside in Virtual DOM and these components will be available as notes in Actual DOM.

-> Virtual DOM is an abstraction of actual DOM, where components are the nodes.We can programatically modify it. These are internally handeled by React and in return, updated by DOM.

**Different frameworks uses different ways like Dirty Checking, Data Binding to update the DOM tree, as its expensive in time to update the DOM tree again and again, if changes are made frequently.**
